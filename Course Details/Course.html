      <h3>What Is HyperText Markup Language (HTML)?</h3>
      <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for
        display on the Internet. The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images.</p>
      <p>Each individual piece markup code (which would fall between "<" and ">" characters) is referred to as an
          element, though many people also refer to it as a tag. Some elements come in pairs that indicate when some
          display effect is to begin and when it is to end.</p> <br>

          <h3>What’s the Difference Between Attributes and HTML Tags?</h3>
          <p>Although this guide is all about HTML tags, it’s important to know the difference between HTML tags,
            elements, and attributes.
            An HTML element is an item on the page; it’s part of the web page’s content. An HTML tag affects how an HTML
            element appears. An HTML attribute describes the characteristics of that element.
            Here’s a breakdown of how elements, tags, and attributes work together:

            HTML tags contain instructions on how to display an on-page element. They begin with a < and end with a> and
              precede and follow the content of the element. (e.g <b> Bold Tag </b>)
              HTML Elements are the on-page content sandwiched within the tags. (<b> Bold Tag </b>)
              HTML Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and appear at within the HTML tag (e.g.
              <html lang="en-US">). </p>
          <p>Each individual piece markup code (which would fall between "<" and ">" characters) is referred to as an
              element, though many people also refer to it as a tag. Some elements come in pairs that indicate when some
              display effect is to begin and when it is to end.</p> </div> <div id="tabs-2">

              <h1 style="text-align: center;">CSS</h1> <br>

              <h3>What Is Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)?</h3>
              <p> CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text,
                the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background
                images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes
                as well as a variety of other effects.</p> <br>
              <h3>What’s CSS Can Do?</h3>
              <p>CSS helps Web developers create a uniform look across several pages of a Web site. Instead of defining
                the style of each table and each block of text within a page's HTML, commonly used styles need to be
                defined only once in a CSS document. Once the style is defined in cascading style sheet, it can be used
                by any page that references the CSS file. Plus, CSS makes it easy to change styles across several pages
                at once. For example, a Web developer may want to increase the default text size from 10pt to 12pt for
                fifty pages of a Web site. If the pages all reference the same style sheet, the text size only needs to
                be changed on the style sheet and all the pages will show the larger text. </p>
              <p>While CSS is great for creating text styles, it is helpful for formatting other aspects of Web page
                layout as well. For example, CSS can be used to define the cell padding of table cells, the style,
                thickness, and color of a table's border, and the padding around images or other objects.2 CSS gives Web
                developers more exact control over how Web pages will look than HTML does. This is why most Web pages
                today incorporate cascading style sheets.</p>

      <h1 style="text-align: center;">JavaScript</h1> <br>

      <h3>What Is JavaScript</h3>
      <p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of
        web
        pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an
        interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
      </p>
      <p> JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the
        excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name
        LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other
        web browsers.</p> <br>

      <h3>Client-Side JavaScript</h3>
      <p>Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced
        by
        an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.

        It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that interact with the user,
        control
        the browser, and dynamically create HTML content.

        The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For
        example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field. </p>
      <p>The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid, they
        would
        be submitted to the Web Server.

        JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions
        that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly.</p>

      <h3>What is Java?</h3>
      <p>Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser
        implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development. Java is fast, secure, and
        reliable, therefore. It is widely used for developing Java applications in laptops, data centers, game
        consoles, scientific supercomputers, cell phones, etc.</p> <br>
      <h3>What is Java Platform?</h3>
      <p>
        Java Platform is a collection of programs that help programmers to develop and run Java programming
        applications efficiently. It includes an execution engine, a compiler, and a set of libraries in it. It is a
        set of computer software and specifications. James Gosling developed the Java platform at Sun Microsystems,
        and the Oracle Corporation later acquired it.</p> <br>

      <h3>What is Java used for?</h3>
